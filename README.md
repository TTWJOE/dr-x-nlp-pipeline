Welcome to the **Dr. X NLP Pipeline** repository! This project offers a fully offline natural language processing (NLP) pipeline designed for extracting, chunking, embedding, querying, summarizing, and translating research documents using local large language models (LLMs). 

Inspired by the fictional mystery of Dr. X, this system supports multiple file formats and features local retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based question and answer capabilities, Arabic translation, and ROUGE-based summarization. Best of all, it operates entirely without cloud dependencies.

## Installation

To set up the Dr. X NLP Pipeline on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TTWJOE/dr-x-nlp-pipeline.git
   cd dr-x-nlp-pipeline
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/TTWJOE/dr-x-nlp-pipeline/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the pipeline.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the Dr. X NLP Pipeline with the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_your_document> --output <desired_output_path>
```

### Example

```bash
python main.py --input documents/research_paper.pdf --output results/summary.txt
```

This command will process the specified document and save the summary to the desired output path.

## Components

The Dr. X NLP Pipeline consists of several key components:

1. **Extractor**: This module extracts text from various document formats, including PDFs, DOCX, and plain text files.

2. **Chunker**: It divides the extracted text into manageable chunks for further processing.

3. **Embedder**: This component generates embeddings for each text chunk, allowing for semantic understanding.

4. **Query Engine**: Users can query the processed documents using natural language.

5. **Summarizer**: This module generates concise summaries using ROUGE metrics to ensure quality.

6. **Translator**: It translates content into Arabic, ensuring accurate and context-aware translations.

## Supported Formats

The Dr. X NLP Pipeline supports the following file formats:

- PDF
- DOCX
- TXT
- HTML

Feel free to add more formats by extending the Extractor module.
